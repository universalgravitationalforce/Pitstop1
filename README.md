# Assignment 1
I create a markdown document with the preface and a section of *Eureka: A Prose Poem* by Edgar Allan Poe as the sample text(from Project Gutenberg). 
# Assignment 2
I use the Open Library of the Internet Archive. I downloaded the *The Tempest* by Shakespeare in pdf format and perfomed OCR using GDrive. After cleaning the text, I converted it into Markdown format.
# Assignment 3
I create a dataset with a list of my favourite books that I read recently with Excel. Then I exported it in .csv format.
