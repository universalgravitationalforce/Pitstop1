## **ACT I.** 

### SCENE I. — *On a Ship at sea. A Storm, with Thunder and Lightning.*

*Enter Master and Boatswain severally.*

  *Mast*. Boatswain ! 

  *Boats*. Here, master: what cheer? 

  *Mast.* Good,[^1] speak to the mariners: fall to't yarely,[^2] or we run ourselves a-ground: bestir, bestir. [*Exit.* 



*Enter Mariners*.  



  *Boats.* Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly**,** my hearts! yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master's whistle. [Exeunt Mariners.] — Blow till thou burst thy wind,[^3] if room enough! [^4]  

*Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and Others.*  

  *Alon.* Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master? Play the men.[^5]  

  *Boats.* I pray now, keep below. 

  *Anto.* Where is the master, boatswain? 

  *Boats.* Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your cabins; you do assist the storm. 

[^1]: Here, as in many other places, *good* is used just as we now use *well*, So a little after: "*Good*, yet remember whom thou hast aboard." Also in *Hamlet*, i. **I** : "*Good* now, sit down, and tell me," &c. In the text, however, it carries something of an evasive force; as, "Let that go"; or, "No matter for that." 
[^2]:  *Yarely is nimbly, briskly, or alertly*. So, in the next speech, *yare*, an imperative verb, is, *be nimble, or be on the alert*. The word is seldom if ever used now in any form, but was much used in the Poet's time. In North's Plutarch we have such phrases as "galleys not *yare* of steerage," and "ships light of *yarage*," and "galleys heavy of *yarage*." 
[^3]: In Shakespeare's time, the wind was often represented pictorially by the figure of a man with his cheeks puffed out to their utmost tension with the act of blowing. Probably the Poet had such a figure in his mind. So in *King Lear*, iii. 2: "Blow, winds, and *crack your cheeks!*" Also in Pericles, iii. **I**: "Blow, and split thyself." 
[^4]: That is, "if *we have* sea-room enough." So in *Pericles*, iii. **I**: "But *sea-room*, an the brine and cloudy billow kiss the Moon, I care not." 
[^5]: Act with spirit, behave like men. So in **2** Samuel, **X. I2**: "Be of good courage, and let us *play the men* for our people." 



&nbsp;&nbsp;*Gonza*. Nay**,** good**,** be patient. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;*Boats*. When the sea is. Hence! What care these roarers for the name of king**?** To cabin: silence! trouble 

us not. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;*Gonza*. Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;*Boats*. None that I more love than myself. You are a counsellor: if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present,[^6] we will not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you cannot**,** give thanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap. — Cheerly, good hearts! — Out of our way, I say.  [*Exit*. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;*Gonza*. I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he hath no drowning-mark upon him; his complexion[^7] is perfect gallows. — Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging! make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage! If he be not born to be hang'd, our case is miserable.  [*Exeunt*. 

*Re-enter* Boatswain. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;*Boats*. Down with the top-mast! [^8] yare; lower, lower! Bring her to try wi'th' main-course.[^9] [*A cry within*.] A 

[^6]:  *Present for present time*. So in the Prayer-Book: "That those things may please Him which we do at this *present*." And in 1 Corinthians, xv. 6: "Of whom the greater part remain unto this *present*." 
[^7]: *Complexion* was often used for *nature, native bent or aptitude*. See *The Merchant of Venice*, page **I**34, note 7. 
[^8]: Of this order Lord Mulgrave, a sailor critic, says, "The striking the top-mast was a new invention in Shakespeare's time, which he here very properly introduces. He has placed his ship in the situation in which it was indisputably right to strike the top-mast, — where he had not sea-room." 
[^9]: This appears to have been a common nautical phrase. So in Hackluyt's *Voyages*, 1598: "And when the bark had way we cut the hauser, and so gat the sea to our friend, and *tried* out all the day *with our maine* course." Also in Smith's *Sea Grammar*, 1627: "Let us lie at *trie with our maine*  



plague upon this howling**!** they are louder than the weather or our office, 10- 

Re-enter SEBASTIAN**,** ANTONIO**,** and GONZALO. 

Yet again what do you here**?** Shall we give o'er, and drown? Have you a mind to sink**?** 

Sebas. A pox o' your throat**,** you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog**!** 

Boats. Work you**,** then**.** 

Anto. Hang, cur**,** hang! you whoreson, insolent noise- maker, we are less afraid to be drown'd 11 than thou art**.** 

Gonza. I'll warrant him for drowning,**12** though the ship were no stronger than a nut-shell. 

Boats. Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses 113 off to sea again; lay her off! 

course." And Sir Walter Raleigh speaks of being "obliged to lye at trye with our main course and mizen," To lie at try is to keep as close to the wind as possible. 

10 Weather for storm. "Their howling drowns both the roaring of the tempest and the commands of the officer," or "our official orders." 

11" Less afraid of being drown'd." So the Poet often uses the infinitive gerundively, or like the Latin gerund**.** See King Lear, page 117**,** note 18**;** also page 205, note 28**.** 

19 As to, or as regards, drowning. A not uncommon use of for. - Gon- zalo has in mind the old proverb, "He that is born to be hanged will never be drowned." 

18 A ship's courses are her largest lower sails; "so called," says Holt, "because they contribute most to give her way through the water, and thus enable her to feel the helm, and steer her course better than when they are not set or spread to the wind." Captain Glascock, another sailor critic, comments thus: "The ship's head is to be put leeward, and the vessel to be drawn off the land under that canvas nautically denominated the two courses." To lay a ship a-hold is to bring her to lie as near the wind as she can, in order to keep clear of the land, and get her out to sea. So Ad- miral Smith, in his Sailors' Wordbook: A hold: A term of our early navis gators, for bringing a ship close to the wind, so as to hold or keep to it."

Re-enter Mariners, wet. 

Mariners. All lost! to prayers, to prayers ! all lost! 

Boats. What**,** must our mouths be cold?

Gonsa. The King and Prince at prayers! let us assist 

them, 

For our case is as theirs. 

Sebas. 

I'm out of patience. 

Anto. We're merely 14 cheated out of our lives by drunk-

A confused noise within. Mercy on us! We split, we split - Farewell, my wife and children!- Farewell, bro- ther! We split, we split, we split ! [Exit Boatswain. 

Anto. Let's all sink wi' th' King. 1 Sebas. Let's take leave of him.

14 Merely, here, is utterly or absolutely. A frequent usage. So in Hamlet, 1. 2: "Things rank and gross in nature possess it merely." 

15 Glut for englut; that is, swallow up.-Widest is here a monosyllable. The same with many words that are commonly two syllables. 

1* This double elision of with and the, so as to draw the two into one syllable, is quite frequent, especially in the Poet's later plays. So before in this scene: "Bring her to try with main course." Single elisions for the same purpose, such as by th', for th, from th, to tA", &c., are still more fre- quent. So in the first speech of the next scene: "Mounting to th' welkin's cheek."
